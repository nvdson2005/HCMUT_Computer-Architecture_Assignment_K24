# Description

This repository includes:

- ACAssignment.asm: The main execution file.

- INT2.BIN: The binary file contains the value of multiplicand and multiplier.

- binary_file_input.cpp and binary_file_output.cpp: Two C++ files that are used to write the values into INT2.BIN and read the information in INT2.BIN.

- Mars45.jar: The executable .jar file used to run MARS.
